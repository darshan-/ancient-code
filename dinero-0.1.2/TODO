maybe have a history for comment editing


online help


show list of all matches for incompletes (and blank) after second tab


get rid of C-a for suspend - leave C-z, C-x C-z, and C-x z


dates with correct ammount of days per month (with always 29 for feb)

options along these lines:
    dinero [-p] [-t] [files]
	-p print account to stdout much like it would appear onscreen - must supply exactly one file name
	-t print account balance (t for total) - must supply exactly one file name

    you can do "dinero -pt" or "dinero -tp"


C-x e (or something like that) - like M-x
    calls get_long_input()
int get_long_input()
    displays "M-x "
    lets you type in a command
    returns int based on command name
	    0 - not a command
	    1 - revert-buffer
	    etc..
    has tab completion


easier editing, at least of comment field
       (can move left and right, and insert characters)


future:
	message_out_get_yes_no() should return -1 for ^G, (don't do anything
	for ^C).  go over to all the places that use this function and
	rewrite.
		killing a buffer should have:
		"Account modified?  Save first? [Y/n] "
			 should do nothing for -1
			 should call save() for 'y'
			 should just kill for 'n'


	tab completion for file names


	a way to retrieve killed text?


let user edit whole comment field, even if the current screen can't
hold it all; scroll right if necessary.  UPDATE: not even have a
'whole' comment field: limetless in length, dynamically allocated
comment field.  main screen already only displays as much as it can;
just scroll right while editing as necessary.


1st line after any malloc should check for NULL, and at the very least
abort
	do xmalloc
