reduce c functions to little more than ioctl calls.  especially print no
output from c (except perhaps errors.  but even here it's probably better
to return an error code and let lisp print error.)  do as much processing
from lisp as possible.  one benefit of this, other than clarity and ease
of maintenance, is that the user can control operation with flags such as

-q, --quiet, --silent
    print no output except errors
-n, --negative
    time left, so like "playing -5/14 -1:32/3:06 -18:43/51:20"

and probably other ways to control output/operation that simply aren't
possible with the current split code.


make "lcdp + 1:00" work  (shouldn't be hard, i should have a function
lying around somewhere to make "1:00" look like 60 (or rather like the
same thing 60 would look like: 1 minute, 0 seconds, 0 frames))

consider having "lcdp +34" and lcdp -27" work just like "lcdp + 34" and
"lcdp - 27"






Makefile should have variables for install directory, these get put into
lisp code because lisp needs the exact location of files for (load)
function









if the command line parameter contains a colon, it is taken as users
intent that paremeter is a time.  the function make-time takes the string
and attempts to make a time structure
