cdp 1.0
by Josiah Barber <josiah_barber@hotmail.com>

cdp is a console cd player for linux released under the terms and
conditions of the GNU GPL (see file COPYING for complete details).


I wanted to listen to cd's on an experimental system that didn't have X.
The only console cd players I could find used curses in order to take over
my screen and act like very poor GUI cd players.  That annoyed me.  So I
wrote the cd player I was looking for.  It is driven from the command
line.  Even though I use X most of the time, the only cd player I use is
cdp because it is way more convenient for me than a GUI cd player, even
under X.

usage: cdp [options]
       cdp              print current status
       cdp i            display info about current cd
       cdp h            display help message
       cdp v            display version
       cdp p            play / pause / unpause
       cdp s            stop
       cdp f            skip forward to the next track
       cdp ff           same, except loop back to track 1 if on last track
       cdp b            skip backward to the previous track
       cdp bb           same, except loop around to last track if on first
       cdp t            go back to start of this track
       cdp c            close tray
       cdp e            eject tray
       cdp 5            play from track 5 to the end of cd
       cdp 3 3          play track 3 only
       cdp 2 4          play tracks 2, 3, and 4
       cdp 4 2          complain about strange command ;)
       cdp 30:00        play starting 30 minutes into cd
       cdp 3 1:00       play starting 1 minute into track 3
       cdp +10          seek forward 10 seconds
       cdp -10          seek backward 10 seconds

    cdp1 talks to /dev/cdrom1 instead of /dev/cdrom

Yeah, link /dev/cdrom to your cdrom device if you want things to work.
Alternatively, you could alter the source before compiling to make cdp
open another device.


INSTALATION:
    make	# make executable.

    # optional installation copies executable to /usr/local/bin
    # and creates soft link cdp1 for second drive
    make install	# must be root.
    #or
    sudo make install	# must be in /etc/sudoers
    

I haven't been doing much with maintaining cdp for the last year until
this minor update to 1.0.  But please still send feedback, just don't
expact too much.   josiah_barber@hotmail.com
